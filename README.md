ChiantiPy is the Python interface to the [CHIANTI atomic database](http://www.chiantidatabase.org) for astrophysical spectroscopy.  It provides the capability to calculate the emission line and continuum spectrum of an optically thin plasma based on the data in the CHIANTI database.

## What is CHIANTI?
CHIANTI provides a database of atomic data that can be used to interpret the emission of spectral lines and continua emitted from high-temperature, optically-thin astrophysical sources.  The CHIANTI project provides a suite of routines written in Interactive Data Language (IDL) to access the database and calculate various quantities for use in interpreting observed spectra or producing synthetic spectra.  As of ChiantiPy 0.10.0, the CHIANTI database version 10 or later is required

## Installation
The following dependencies are required to run ChiantiPy,

* [Python3](https://www.python.org/) (Python 3 is now required as of version 0.8.0)
* [Numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [Scipy](https://www.scipy.org/)
* [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
* [ipyparallel](https://github.com/ipython/ipyparallel)

The following two are extremely useful for running Python programs
* [IPython](http://ipython.org)
* [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/)


Optionally, if you'd like to use the GUI dialogs,

* [PyQt5](https://riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro)

If you are not familiar with installing Python and the needed dependencies, we recommend the [Anaconda platform](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). Next, download the [CHIANTI database](http://www.chiantidatabase.org/chianti_download.html), version 10.0 or later. Assuming you've placed the CHIANTI tree in `$HOME`, set the environment variable in your `.bashrc` file,
```Shell
export XUVTOP=$HOME/MY_CHIANTI_DIRECTORY
```
should point to the top directory of your CHIANTI distribution

The release is also available on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/ChiantiPy/)

```Shell
$ python3 -m pip install ChiantiPy
```

Or, clone and install the source from GitHub,
```Shell
$ git clone --recursive https://github.com/chianti-atomic/ChiantiPy.git
$ cd ChiantiPy
$ python setup.py install
```

## Usage
As a quick example, we'll calculate the populations of the top 10 levels of Fe XIV as a function of temperature at constant density and plot them:
```Python
>>> import ChiantiPy.core as ch
>>> import numpy as np
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> temperature = np.logspace(5.8,6.8,21)
>>> fe14 = ch.ion('fe_14',temperature=temperature,eDensity=1.e+9,em=1.e+27)
>>> fe14.popPlot()
>>> plt.show()
```
