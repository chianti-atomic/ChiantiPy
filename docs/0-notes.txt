in /docs
sphinx quick-start
    this creates build and source directories + Makefile
    in the source directory, an conf.py and index.rst
    move the usual document .rst files into source
    move _templates/layout.rst into _templates
    move all the _static files (mostly png) into the new _static

in /docs

sphinx-apidoc  -o source/api ../ChiantiPy

then need to exit stuff in api ChiantiPy.base.rst to include the methods

sphinxdoc.css - line 20 14px -> 16px

in api/index need to make link to ChiantiPy_logo to read ../_static/...
    however, this only works for one more level down
    can do this with text_replace
