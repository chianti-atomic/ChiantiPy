ChiantiPy Documentation
=======================

Welcome to the ChiantiPy documentation. ChiantiPy is a pure Python package for performing calculations of astrophysical spectra using the `CHIANTI atomic database <http://www.chiantidatabase.org/>`_.

The latest version of ChiantiPy is 0.15.1 and is compatible with CHIANTI database version 10.0.X. It is not compatible with previous versions

ChiantiPy v0.15.1 is released under the OSI approved ISC license.

It is functionally equivalent to the simplified BSD and MIT/Expat licenses, ...

`CHIANTI <http://www.chiantidatabase.org/>`_ consists of a database of atomic data that can be used to interpret spectral lines and continua emitted from high-temperature, optically-thin astrophysical sources.
